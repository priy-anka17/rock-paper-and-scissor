# rock-paper-and-scissor
I have created a rock, paper, and scissors game using Python. In this game. The rules of the game are as follows:

Rock smashes scissors.
Scissors cut paper.
Paper covers rock.
The game allows multiple rounds, so players can continue playing until a certain condition is met, such as winning two out of three rounds. The game starts by asking the players for their choices and then determines the winner based on the rules mentioned above.
